1. List is a data structure used to store group of elements and these elements can store different types of data (int, float, string)

2. It is useful as it stores multiple variables in a single element.

3. The stored data can be organised and multiple operations can be performed.

Characteristics of list datatype:
-> Ordered
-> Mutable
-> Dynamic
-> Heterogeneous

Ways of creating a list:
1. using square brackets
   my_list = [1,2,3,10.56,"hello",False]

2. using list constructor
   my_list = ((1,2,3,10.56,"hello",False))

3. using range function
   my_list = list(range(start, stop, step))

4. using list comprehension
   my_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
   squares = [i ** 2 for in in range(1,11) if i%2 == 0]
